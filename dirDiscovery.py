# Script Name: dirDiscovery
# Description: Script can gather some basic information from dir structure to show file types and path to each file of that type
# Author: CarterLankford
# Date: 9/25/24
#
# Usage: To use this script, simply run it with the following command: python [script_name].py [optional arguments].
# 
# Parameters: None
#
# Parameters: <arg1:Main Swtch(scan, test)>//<arg2:setup, copy, dump, testarg(get name for this)>//<arg3:>
# 
# Dev Notes:
# â€¢ Script will always create file dump in directory it's run from.
##TODO:Task-Update above with accurate info, just jotted some stuff down while the idea was fresh
##TODO:Task-Refresh code. This was written to get a job done quickly. Need to re-write to make it more efficent and correct. - Nothing is more perm then a temp solution.

"""
Goals and planning

Python <target path> <file type(str)>

create dir for x if !exist: 
Payload
payload/log
payload/log/target
payload/output

os command to pull all path/files into array
sort algorithym to put each unique file/path type in own array 

for each file type array
    update log for each file type with current values appened
    make dir for each file type

log to unique file -- create an entry in the log file for each file/path to show result 
update log with summary of findings (44jpeg found on 4/4/2012 total file size etc)

copy the deseried arrays file paths to the payload/output folder

add a sys arg at the begining of the code to allow a clean mode/help/test



make a master list
make lists for each file type
log them to csv
name file<1> etc and have the first value be the file type



pull file list types
<main part>
if arg 1 is file type ignore most of loop and only get that file type

using a for each could copy one path to one destination path which can be accepted by a definition to handle each copy processes ##Idea: can that be threaded and if so should it?
</main part>
get list of all file paths of that type
copy all of those files to another directory

if they have the same name, rename one. like maybe even add a number betweeen the last char and the . 
compare path count with number of files in payload dir
